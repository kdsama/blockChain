Multiple Chain Validation 
Miners will have their own version of chain 
If a miner wants to add a block to chain, to update the overall system, It has to be submitted to all the chains 
We need to  make sure new block is valid 
The one submitted with more blocks is usually the on that is accepted as a priority 
This may ? help with the issue of forks where multiple miners are submitting same no of blocks . So half the receivers will have different blocks at nth position 
If third person extends first person block , now third persons version will be accepted for all the chains. Also, second person's block will be added on next. 



Hash validation :- Re-Hash is done, if after re-hashing the values dont match , it means that data has been tampered.
