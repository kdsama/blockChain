Proof of Work System 

A system that requires miners to do computational work to add blocks
Any peer can replace the blockchain (long enough and valid hash data)
The proof of work makes it expensive to generate corrupt chains for dishonest miners
Manageable to submit one block, unproductive to generate an entire chain
Bitcoin uses it. It uses Hashcash. 
Hashcash was a proof of work system used to prevent email spamming, DOS attacks

 At a given time , the blockchain will have a level of difficulty. 
 So if a miner wants to add a block, they would need to create a
  hash in correspondance to the difficulty of the blockchain at the moment


  difficulty : 6 

  Hash = 000000haxi2910jasdflk
  Miners would need to find a hash that has same number of leading zeroes as the difficulty level
  As difficulty rises , finding a hash with same number of leading zeroes becomes difficult exponentially
  Miner will generate hash based on the data of the blockchain. But wont the hash be the same throughout ? 
  A NONCE is used as a variable parameter. The miners adjust it in the quest to find hash 
  with same number of leading zeroes

  Nonce can only be used once to generate hash of a block 
  Once found , this nonce value will be saved to the block 
  Once the other miners know this nonce value, they can verify validity of the 
  solution and add the block to their own blockchain
  This way frequency of adding new blocks can be controlled
  a bitcoin sets the rate to add a new block around every 10 minutes 


  51 % Attack ==> happens on pow system 
  what if a dishonest miner has more than 51% of the networks power ??
  They can replace current blockchain with one that will favor them 
  pow makes it so  difficult that its useless 
  in 2018 , a 51% attack for bitcoind would cost around $6 billion



Dynamic Block difficulty
Block difficulty should increase as more and more miners are added 
we add difficulty attribute to each block 
Also we add Mine rate :- rate at which we want a block to be mined 


If concurrent blocks had a time difference of x seconds , 
which is less than the mine rate, It means its been too easy, 
and hence we will increase the rate of mining 

If its too slow, we will decrease the block mine rate
